## 🚀 Usage

### Accessing Verification Page

**For Users**:
```
http://yourdomain.com/verification
```

**For Admins**:
```
http://yourdomain.com/admin/verifications
```

### Check Verification Status in Code

```php
// Check if user has submitted verification
if (auth()->user()->hasVerification()) {
    // Verification exists
}

// Check if user is fully verified
if (auth()->user()->isVerified()) {
    // User is verified
}

// Check if verification is pending
if (auth()->user()->hasVerificationPending()) {
    // Awaiting admin review
}

// Get verification details
$verification = auth()->user()->verification;
if ($verification) {
    $status = $verification->verification_status;
    $ninVerified = $verification->is_nin_verified;
    $completionPercentage = $verification->getCompletionPercentage();
}
```

### Require Verification for Actions

```php
// In controller
public function postAdvert(Request $request)
{
    if (!auth()->user()->isVerified()) {
        return redirect()->route('verification.index')
            ->with('error', 'Please complete verification to post adverts.');
    }

    // Continue with posting advert
}
```

### Display Verification Badge

```blade
@if(auth()->user()->isVerified())
    <span class="badge bg-green-500 text-white">✓ Verified</span>
@elseif(auth()->user()->hasVerificationPending())
    <span class="badge bg-yellow-500 text-white">⏳ Pending</span>
@else
    <a href="{{ route('verification.index') }}" class="badge bg-gray-500 text-white">
        Verify Account
    </a>
@endif
```

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

### Data Protection

1. **Encrypted Storage**:
   - All documents stored securely in `storage/app/public/verifications/`
   - Access controlled through Laravel storage system

2. **Access Control**:
   - Only user and admins can view verification details
   - Documents not publicly accessible

3. **Sensitive Data**:
   - NIN is unique and indexed
   - Bank details encrypted in database (recommended to add encryption)

### File Upload Security

- **Allowed file types**: PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG
- **Max file size**: 2MB per document
- **Storage**: `/storage/app/public/verifications/{type}/`
- **Validation**: Mime type validation on upload

### Rate Limiting

```php
// Verification submission: 3 attempts per 10 minutes
Route::post('/verification', [...])->middleware('throttle:3,10');
```

---

## 📈 Admin Dashboard Features

### Verification Statistics

Create admin dashboard widget to show:
```php
$stats = [
    'pending' => UserVerification::pending()->count(),
    'verified' => UserVerification::verified()->count(),
    'rejected' => UserVerification::where('verification_status', 'rejected')->count(),
    'completion_rate' => (UserVerification::verified()->count() / User::count()) * 100,
];
```

### Filter Verifications

```php
// In admin controller
$verifications = UserVerification::with('user')
    ->when($request->status, function($query, $status) {
        $query->where('verification_status', $status);
    })
    ->when($request->search, function($query, $search) {
        $query->where('full_name', 'like', "%{$search}%")
              ->orWhere('nin', 'like', "%{$search}%");
    })
    ->latest()
    ->paginate(20);
```

## 🔍 Dispute Resolution

### Using Verification Data

When disputes arise between buyers and sellers:

1. **Identify Users**:
   ```php
   $buyer = User::find($disputeData['buyer_id']);
   $seller = User::find($disputeData['seller_id']);

   // Check verification status
   if ($buyer->isVerified() && $seller->isVerified()) {
       // Both parties verified - high trust
   }
   ```

2. **Access Contact Information**:
   ```php
   $sellerInfo = $seller->verification;
   $contactPhone = $sellerInfo->phone_number;
   $contactWhatsApp = $sellerInfo->whatsapp_number;
   $address = $sellerInfo->address . ', ' . $sellerInfo->city;
   ```

3. **Verify Identity**:
   ```php
   // NIN can be used to verify with government database
   $nin = $sellerInfo->nin;

   // Check if NIN was admin-verified
   if ($sellerInfo->is_nin_verified) {
       // Admin confirmed NIN document
   }
   ```

4. **Bank Details for Refunds**:
   ```php
   // Issue refund to verified account
   if ($buyer->verification->is_bank_verified) {
       $bankDetails = [
           'bank' => $buyer->verification->bank_name,
           'account' => $buyer->verification->account_number,
           'name' => $buyer->verification->account_name,
       ];

       // Process refund
   }
   ```
