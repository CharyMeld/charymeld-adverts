# Security Features Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of comprehensive security features including:
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Account Recovery System
- Security Reporting System
- Admin Review Panel

## Database Structure

### Tables Created:
1. `two_factor_authentications` - Stores 2FA codes and attempts
2. `account_recovery_requests` - Hacked account recovery requests
3. `security_reports` - User reports for unwanted activities
4. `users` (updated) - Added 2FA fields

## Features

### 1. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

- `/profile/security/2fa/recovery-codes` - View recovery codes
- `/login/2fa` - 2FA verification during login

**User Flow:**
1. User enables 2FA in security settings
2. System generates secret key and QR code
3. User scans QR code with authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy)
4. User enters verification code to confirm
5. System generates 10 recovery codes
6. On login, user enters password then 2FA code
