# 💳 Payment Gateway Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Paystack and Flutterwave to receive payments directly into your bank account.

## 🎯 Overview

When users pay for adverts on your platform:
1. User selects a plan (Regular/Featured/Premium)
2. User pays through Paystack or Flutterwave
3. Payment gateway processes the payment
4. Money is automatically settled to your registered bank account
5. Your system activates the user's advert

### 1.3 Get API Keys

**For Testing (Sandbox):**
1. Login to Paystack Dashboard: https://dashboard.paystack.com
2. Go to: **Settings** → **API Keys & Webhooks**
3. Copy your **Test Keys**:
   - Test Public Key: `pk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`
   - Test Secret Key: `sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`

**For Production (Live):**
1. After KYC approval, toggle to "Live" mode
2. Copy your **Live Keys**:

- **Transaction Fee**: 1.5% + ₦100 (capped at ₦2,000 per transaction)
- **Settlement Account**: Automatically paid to your registered bank account
- **Payout Schedule**: Automatic daily settlements

**Example Calculation:**
- Customer pays: ₦5,000
- Paystack fee: (5,000 × 1.5%) + ₦100 = ₦75 + ₦100 = ₦175
- You receive: ₦5,000 - ₦175 = **₦4,825**
