# Live Support Chat Feature

## Overview
The AI chatbot now supports seamless handoff to live human support agents when users need real assistance!

## How It Works

### For Users:
1. **Start chatting** with the AI assistant via the bottom-right chat button
2. **Ask for support** by saying things like:
   - "connect me to support"
   - "I need to talk to a human"
   - "connect me to a support agent"
   - "speak to someone"
   - Or ask about contact/support, and the AI will offer to connect you

3. **Get connected** - The AI will immediately notify the support team and update the chat header to show you're being connected

4. **Chat live** - Once a support agent joins, you'll see:
   - Header changes to "Live Support Team"
   - Green indicator showing you're connected to a real person
   - All your messages go directly to the support agent

### For Support Team (Admins):
1. **Access Support Dashboard** - Navigate to "Support Chat" in the admin menu

2. **View Pending Requests** - See all users waiting for support with:
   - User information
   - Latest message preview
   - How long they've been waiting

3. **Respond to Requests** - Click "Respond" to:
   - Automatically connect to the conversation
   - Send personalized messages
   - View full conversation history

4. **Active Chats** - Manage ongoing support conversations:
   - See which agent is handling each conversation
   - Jump into any active chat
   - Continue conversations seamlessly

5. **Resolve Tickets** - Mark conversations as resolved when done:
   - Sends automatic closing message
   - Moves to resolved history
   - User can start a new conversation if needed
