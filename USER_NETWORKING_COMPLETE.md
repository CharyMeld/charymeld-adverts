## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Run Database Migrations
```bash
# Start MySQL if not running
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp startmysql

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate
```

### 2. Install FFmpeg System Package
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

# Verify installation
ffmpeg -version
```

### 3. Create Storage Directories
```bash
# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p storage/app/public/videos
mkdir -p storage/app/public/thumbnails
mkdir -p storage/app/public/profiles/covers
mkdir -p storage/app/public/groups/covers
mkdir -p storage/app/public/chat/attachments

# Set permissions
chmod -R 775 storage/app/public

# Link storage to public
php artisan storage:link
```

### 4. Configure Laravel Reverb for WebSockets

**Install and configure (if not done):**
```bash
php artisan reverb:install
```

**Update `.env`:**
```env
BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb

REVERB_APP_ID=your-app-id
REVERB_APP_KEY=your-app-key
REVERB_APP_SECRET=your-app-secret
REVERB_HOST="localhost"
REVERB_PORT=8080
REVERB_SCHEME=http

VITE_REVERB_APP_KEY="${REVERB_APP_KEY}"
VITE_REVERB_HOST="${REVERB_HOST}"
VITE_REVERB_PORT="${REVERB_PORT}"
VITE_REVERB_SCHEME="${REVERB_SCHEME}"
```

**Start Reverb server:**
```bash
php artisan reverb:start
```

### 5. Update Broadcast Events in Controllers

Uncomment the broadcast lines in:
- `DirectChatController.php` line 81
- `DirectChatController.php` line 153
- `GroupChatController.php` line 52
- `GroupChatController.php` line 109

Change from:
```php
// broadcast(new MessageSent($message))->toOthers();
```

To:
```php
broadcast(new MessageSent($message))->toOthers();
```

### 6. Setup Frontend WebSocket Client

**Install Laravel Echo and Pusher JS:**
```bash
npm install --save-dev laravel-echo pusher-js
```

**Configure in `resources/js/bootstrap.js`:**
```javascript
import Echo from 'laravel-echo';
import Pusher from 'pusher-js';

window.Pusher = Pusher;

window.Echo = new Echo({
    broadcaster: 'reverb',
    key: import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_APP_KEY,
    wsHost: import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_HOST,
    wsPort: import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_PORT,
    wssPort: import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_PORT,
    forceTLS: (import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_SCHEME ?? 'https') === 'https',
    enabledTransports: ['ws', 'wss'],
});
```

**Build assets:**
```bash
npm run build
```

### 7. Create View Files

You'll need to create Blade template files for:

**Profile Views:**
- `resources/views/profile/show.blade.php` - User profile page
- `resources/views/profile/edit.blade.php` - Edit profile form
- `resources/views/profile/followers.blade.php` - Followers list
- `resources/views/profile/following.blade.php` - Following list

**Group Views:**
- `resources/views/groups/index.blade.php` - Groups listing
- `resources/views/groups/create.blade.php` - Create group form
- `resources/views/groups/show.blade.php` - Group detail page
- `resources/views/groups/edit.blade.php` - Edit group form
- `resources/views/groups/members.blade.php` - Group members list
- `resources/views/groups/chat.blade.php` - Group chat interface

**Chat Views:**
- `resources/views/chat/index.blade.php` - Conversations list
- `resources/views/chat/show.blade.php` - Chat interface

**Video Views:**
- `resources/views/videos/index.blade.php` - Video gallery
- `resources/views/videos/create.blade.php` - Upload form
- `resources/views/videos/show.blade.php` - Video player
- `resources/views/videos/edit.blade.php` - Edit video form

### 8. JavaScript for Real-time Chat

**Example: Listen for direct messages**
```javascript
// In your chat view
Echo.private(`user.${userId}`)
    .listen('.message.sent', (e) => {
        appendMessageToChat(e.message);
        playNotificationSound();
    });
```

**Example: Listen for group messages**
```javascript
Echo.private(`group.${groupId}`)
    .listen('.group.message.sent', (e) => {
        appendMessageToGroupChat(e.message);
    });
```

**Example: Presence channel (online users)**
```javascript
Echo.join('online')
    .here((users) => {
        console.log('Currently online:', users);
        displayOnlineUsers(users);
    })
    .joining((user) => {
        console.log(user.name + ' is now online');
        addUserToOnlineList(user);
    })
    .leaving((user) => {
        console.log(user.name + ' went offline');
        removeUserFromOnlineList(user);
    });
```
